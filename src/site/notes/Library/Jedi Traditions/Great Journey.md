# Great Journey
The Great Journey was undertaken by all members of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Je'daii Order\|Je'daii Order]] as Je'daii Journeyers. It was considered a stage of training, on their way to become Rangers and perhaps Masters. After completing their Padawan training, Journeyers undertook this ritualistic pilgrimage to visit all nine of the Je'daii Temples, which were spread out across four different continents on the vast oceans of [[Navigational/Planets/Tython\|Tython]]. Journeyers would face different environments on each continent; vicious beasts and deadly plants; violent [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force storm\|Force storms]] and anomalous weather patterns; treacherous terrain and unfathomable depths. 

Journeyers were expected to complete training under each of the Nine Masters, exploring broad ranges of studies at each Temple and being granted the opportunity to find their true callings in the Force. 

*"It will be the Great Journey. Journeyers may walk, or ride on beasts or in mechanical vehicles, but it will be their first self-sustained adventure across Tython's surface, visiting each temple to learn and refine their talents in the Force. Tython is a tumultous place, and our new home still has countless hidden corners and depths unplumbed. Every Journeyer will encounter different dangers. Many will find their travels treacherous and troubling. And there are inevitably some who will not survive. But to exist in smooth balance within the Force, one must first confront its sharp edges."* — Je'daii Temple Master Nordia Gral
