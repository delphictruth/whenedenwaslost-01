# Battlelords
The Battlelords were a class of Sith warriors who served under the Sith Lord [[Characters/Darth Rivan\|Darth Rivan]] during the [[Events/New Sith Wars\|New Sith Wars]]. The Sith Battlelords were leaders within Rivan's personal armies who managed to bond themselves to the troops they commanded using the Force and a series of complex rituals involving [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Sith magic\|Sith magic]]. Through this particular bond, the Battlelords were able to reduce desertion rates and strengthen their armies. 

However, after the Battlelords' destruction in 1000 BBY by a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force storm\|Force storm]] created by the [[Weapons/Darkstaff\|Darkstaff]], the surviving Sith moved away from the practice of creating battlelords. The precise details of how to create such battlelords were lost over time and although tomes detailing the rituals were recovered from Rivan's fortress, these tomes were lost when the [[Library/Jedi Archives\|Jedi Archives]] were invaded. Prior to the Jedi's collapse, all attempts to replicate the rituals were unsuccessful, and there are no records of any modern battlelords. A study of the rituals was contained in the Jedi publication [[Library/Speculations on Tactics of the Sith\|Speculations on Tactics of the Sith]], along with a detailed analysis of the battlelords' abilities. 

Some Jedi philosophers have speculated that the magic used to create the battlelords was similar to the Force ability [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Battle Meditation\|Battle Meditation]] or to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Battle Meditation\|Sith battle coordination]]. However, the mystery surrounding the rituals and the unique details transcribed in records suggest that the magic is distinct. 

"The advent of the battlelords threatened for a time to further the tide of the Sith wars in the favor of the dark side." — *Speculations on Tactics of the Sith*
