- Also known as *Prince Jonnas*
# Alfred Jonnas | Deco Ren
>The Knight, Prince of Artorias

Alfred is the crown Prince of [[Navigational/Planets/Artorias\|Artorias]], but he left his home planet when he presented as Force-sensitive and essentially gave up his heritage, though he always intended to return home one day. He lacks some of the standard abilities of the Jedi, such as telekinesis and levitation, and practices more creative uses of the Force instead. He has a strong sense of honor, but does not take much interest in the political drama of the galaxy; he is rather indifferent to the Jedi and Sith alike.

## Combat

Alfred lacks some standard Force abilities, such as telekinesis and levitation; as such, his fighting style relies more heavily on physical damage and creative uses of other Force abilities instead. He fights with non-lethal intent where possible and has a peculiar emphasis on honor.

### Forms

Alfred specializes in [[Forms & Martial Arts/Shii-Cho (I)\|Shii-Cho (I)]], though he does dip into [[Forms & Martial Arts/Soresu (III)\|Soresu (III)]] as needed. His style closely resembles that of traditional sword-fighting, with simplistic and controlled movements, but his strange usage of the Force adds a level of unpredictability.

## Weapons

### Jedi Saber

Alfred's Jedi lightsaber had a standard [[Crystals/Adegan\|Ilum]] crystal that gave the blade a yellow-green hue. It had a cross-guard hilt that gave the lightsaber the appearance of a more traditional sword. After the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|Fall of the Jedi Praxeum]], he gave the crystal to [[Characters/Versailles Cordelia\|Versailles Cordelia]] to create her first saber. 

### Darksider Saber

Alfred's darksider lightsaber was formed from a new [[Crystals/Dragite\|Dragite]] crystal, which makes the blade give a dull ringing sound when struck. Occasionally, it can let off sonic damage. The blade is red and cased in another cross-guard styled hilt. 
## History & Plot Significance

Alfred is the technical Prince of Artorias, but left his people and his post to pursue life as a Jedi when it became apparent that he was Force sensitive; he never had much interest in ruling and is happy to leave the kingdom to his younger sister, preferring more to be a "soldier" and had some intention to return to act as a Jedi guard for his family eventually.
