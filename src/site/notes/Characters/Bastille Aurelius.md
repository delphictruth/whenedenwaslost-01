## Combat
Bastille is an extremely versatile fighter, having reached some level of mastery with all of the standard seven Forms and some lesser styles. He seems to have a natural talent for combat with particularly strong [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Battle Precognition\|Battle Precognition]], but some of his knowledge arises from his connection with [[Characters/Dark Lord Echko\|Dark Lord Echko]] as well. 
### Forms
Bastille specializes in [[Forms & Martial Arts/Niman (VI)\|Niman (VI)]], particularly in the reverse-grip and dual wield styles. He is highly versatile in combat, dabbling in most of the Forms, but he prefers unpredictability of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Juyo (VII)\|Juyo (VII)]] and the swift counter-attacks of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Djem So (V)\|Djem So (V)]]. He primarily keeps his off-hand free for use of Force attacks mid-combat. 
### Force Beliefs & Usage
Though Bastille is classically trained in the teachings of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Order\|Jedi Order]], he has been haunted by the Sith all his life and studied the history of many Force sects. He is mostly closely aligned with the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Grey Jedi\|Grey Jedi]] practices, though in reality he follows no individual path.

## Weapons

### Jedi Saber
Bastille's Jedi lightsaber from his time at the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Praxeum\|Praxeum]]. He chose not to [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Bleed\|bleed]] the [[Crystals/Lightsaber crystal\|crystal]] for his new weapon, and instead continues to wield it when dual-wielding given the relatively neutral attunement of the crystal. It has a silver modified hilt stylized for [[Forms & Martial Arts/Djem So (V)\|Form V]], more rigid and slightly longer for single or double hand grips, and has separate facets for offenses and defense. It is powered by an [[Attuned crystal\|attuned]] [[Crystals/Permafrost\|Permafrost]] crystal, which gives the blade an icy blue color.

### Darksider Saber
After recovering the lost [[Crystals/Darksaber\|Darksaber]], Bastille dismantled it to take the [[Crystals/Lightsaber crystal\|crystal]] that used to power it. He built a new casing, nearly identical to his Jedi lightsaber but utilizing a matte black steel for the hilt. The black blade that is produced is unstable and static-y in appearance, often letting off bursts of electricity in response to hightened emotional states. 
## History & Plot Significance
Bastille Aurelius is the legacy of two iconic families from the [[Events/Timeline#Galatic Civil War Era\|Galactic Civil War]], and he has had an extremely chaotic life to show for it. He was primarily raised by his aunts, [[Characters/Talia Draig\|Talia Draig]] and [[Characters/Malkyn Rodarch\|Malkyn Rodarch]], and believed [[Characters/Malkyn Rodarch\|Malkyn Rodarch]] to be his mother for the majority of his life. He was 15 when the scandal of him being the Sith [[Characters/Raegal Aurelius\|Raegal Aurelius]]'s son became public knowledge, and Bastille thought the truth explained the oddities of his life.

He has always been able to hear the Sith of the past in his thoughts, and seems to have a peculiar connection to the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force ghost\|Force ghosts]] who have haunted him all his life. His temperment reflected the chaos frequently as a child, and he was watched very closely by [[Characters/Dahlia Coutier\|Dahlia Coutier]] at the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Praxeum\|Jedi Praxeum]] for fear that he was naturally inclined towards the Dark side. This suspicion grew among the other Knights and Padawans after his parentage was revealed, and most thought that something like the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|Fall of the Jedi Praxeum]] was inevitable. 

Ironically, when the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|Fall]] finally came, Bastille was not at the heart of it. Instead, he took [[Characters/Roman Ange\|Roman Ange]]'s place in order to spare the young Padawan and because everyone assumed that he had been the one to call down the Sith [[Characters/Darth Grimm\|Darth Grimm]] in the first place. He planned to turn his exile into an opportunity, but was surprisingly joined by the majority of his [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Praxeum\|Jedi Padawan Class]] in his defection. 

They later emerged as the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Knights of Ren\|Knights of Ren]] of the [[Organizations/First Order\|First Order]], whom many who had known them were able to connect to [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Praxeum#Jedi Padawan Class III\|Jedi Padawan Class III]]. To the rest of the Galaxy, he became *Ani Ren*, personal Warlord of the [[Characters/Snoke\|Supreme Leader]].
