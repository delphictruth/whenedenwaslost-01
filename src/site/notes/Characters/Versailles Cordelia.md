## Combat

Summary

### Forms

Versailles likes to consider herself a [[Forms & Martial Arts/Niman (VI)\|Niman (VI)]] specialist, in part because she model her initial style on [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Bastille Aurelius]]'s and in part because she prefers the flexibility it offers to other forms of weapons. Notably, she most frequently uses her saber tonfas, which lend themselves to [[Forms & Martial Arts/Jar'Kai\|Jar'Kai tactics]] such as [[Forms & Martial Arts/Niman (VI)\|Niman]]. 

She has a lot of [[Forms & Martial Arts/Ataru (IV)\|Ataru (IV)]] influence in how she fights. She is a big fan of the kinectic fashion of Form IV and employs a lot of flips and acrobatics in her style. The offensive nature also suits her better than the more passive [[Forms & Martial Arts/Shii-Cho (I)\|Shii-Cho (I)]] of her Padawan years.

## Weapons

### Darksider Saber / Saber Shoto

Versailles' first lightsaber is her darksider saber, seeing how she had not yet made her own lightsaber before the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|Fall of the Jedi Praxeum]]. [[Characters/Alfred Jonnas\|Alfred Jonnas]] gave her the [[Crystals/Adegan\|Ilum]] crystal from his original lightsaber, which she [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Bleed\|bled]] to form her original red blade.

However, she later dismantled the saber, trying to modify it to suit her more, and accidentally shattered the crystal. The blade was reduced to an unstable dagger-like shoto, which Versailles still keeps in her collection. 

### Saber Tonfas

Versailles' second set of weapons is also her most commonly used arrangement. It is comprised of two saber tonfas, with identical red blades formed from two [[Crystals/Qixoni\|Qixoni]] crystals. The crystals strengthen the resulting blades, and can heighten the wielder's connection to the Force during use. 

### Lightwhip

Versailles has also has a lightwhip designed after those used in the Old Republic era. Her whip has two tendrils, each powered by its own individual crystal. This first has an [[Crystals/Allya's Exile\|Allya's Exile]] crystal, which makes the strand incredibly hot and dark red in tone. The second has a [[Crystals/Blackwing\|Blackwing]] crystal, which makes the strand a dark, smoky ash-black. Both crystals were gifted to her by [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Bastille Aurelius]].

### Extra

Versailles has a range of additional weapons that she experiments with and tinkers on. She toys with uniquely styled blasters, other alternatives to the standard lightsaber from the Old Republic era, and occasionally vibroblades. 

## History & Plot Significance

Versailles was born to smugglers on [[Navigational/Planets/Corellia\|Corellia]], and ultimately raised by a band of smugglers as opposed to any specific parents. She still doesn't know if her actual parents were among those that helped raise her or not, and has no idea of their names. In fact, it is believed that her last name, Cordelia, is actually derived from the plant itself in place of a true name from her parents.

When she was 9 years old, Jadi Padawan [[Characters/Bastille Aurelius\|Bastille Rodarch Draig]] [13] sensed her on Corellia while on a mission and came with Jedi Master [[Characters/Rathos Visio\|Rathos Visio]] [41] and fellow Padawan [[Characters/Bardolph Vos\|Bardolph Vos]] [14] to bring her to the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Jedi Praxeum\|Jedi Praxeum]]. She has a deep loyalty to and close relationship with Bastille as a result, so much so that she considers him her elder brother. 

During the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|Fall of the Jedi Praxeum]], Versailles can be considered one of the key instigators. She was the first one to intervene and block Grand Jedi Master [[Characters/Dahlia Coutier\|Dahlia Coutier]] from Bastille, kicking off the chain of events that led to the rest of the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Knights of Ren\|Knights of Ren]] defecting. 

She experiences [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Fallout\|Fallout]] from the trauma of the [[Events/Fall of the Jedi Praxeum\|Fall]]. As a result, and as a byproduct of how young she was when they defected and were retrained in the Dark side, she is particularly vulnerable to its influence. She loses control more easily than the older Knights, though not nearly as badly as [[Characters/Roman Ange\|Roman Ange]].
