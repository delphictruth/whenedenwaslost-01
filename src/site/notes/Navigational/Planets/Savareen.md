# Savareen

Savareen is a planet located on one of the spurs of the [[Navigational/Hyperlanes/Kessel Run\|Kessel Run]] in the [[Navigational/Regions/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]]. It is mostly comprised of sandy landmasses and huge oceans. Supposedly, [[Characters/Maz Kanata\|Maz Kanata]] once considered the planet as a base for her operations.

## Pnakotic Coast

The Pnakotic Coast is a stretch of coastline on the planet [[Navigational/Planets/Savareen\|Savareen]]. There is a small costal village located here, as well as Bis Refinery. 

### Bis Refinery

Bis Refinery is a fuel refinery on the Coast. It runs very limited operations on the downlow, but it occasionally refines valuable products for smugglers (many of whom are coming from [[Navigational/Planets/Kessel\|Kessel]] with their stolen goods).

## Dry Gulch

Dry Gulch is a settlement on the southern hemisphere of Savareen, rather removed from the village on Pnakotic Coast. It has its own independent [[Fauna & Flora/Coaxium\|Coaxium]] refinery.
