# Pydyr
Pydyr is the wealthiest moon of [[Navigational/Planets/Almania\|Almania]], a planet located in the [[Navigational/Sectors/Mortex sector\|Mortex sector]] of the [[Navigational/Regions/Outer Rim\|Outer Rim]]. Its primary terrain includes oceans and hills, and it is the home of the [[Fauna & Flora/Seafah\|Seafah]] shellfish that is featured in Pydyrian jewelry and frescoes. It is also the origin of [[Fauna & Flora/Pydyrian healing sticks\|Pydyrian healing sticks]], their primary export. 

In approximately 3 [[Events/Timeline\|BBY]], the [[Force Traditions & Sects/Fallanassi\|Fallanassi]] fled from their homeworld and settled on the mostly abandoned moon. They were able to live in relative harmony with the native Pydyrians.
