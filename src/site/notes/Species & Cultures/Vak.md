# Vak

Vak philosophy valued both unity and the individual. Vaks had a concept of thought lines, which encompassed individual and group points-of-view. However, as Thrawn later realized from Admiral Ar'alani, the Vaks' desire to see all points of view did not mean all points of view had equal weight. As he later explained, their artwork would have no clear focus if all lines had equal impact. To decide which lines of thought were more important than the others, something more important than simply choosing what lines of thought they liked the best was having trust in a line of thought.
