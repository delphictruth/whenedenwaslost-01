# Aing-Tii
The Aing-Tii are a secretive species of monks native to an undisclosed world within the [[Kathol Rift\|Kathol Rift]], the location of which is a closely guarded secret. They are a highly reclusive species that is quick to resort to violence to dissuade outsiders from probing too far into their world. 

Most of these monks are [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitive]] and view the Force in a unique fashion — described as viewing the Force not in terms of black and white but as "a full-color rainbow." Their belief system held that all events are not necessarily predetermined, but "guided" by the Force. Additionally, they believed that their Force talents were sacred gifts from their deities, "Those Who Dwell Beyond the Veil," and not to be used lightly. 

One such Force power developed by the Aing-Tii is [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Flow-walking\|Flow-walking]].
