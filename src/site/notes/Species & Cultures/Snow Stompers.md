# Snow Stompers

Otherwise known as *Akurians*, Snow Stompers are the native species of the icy planet [[Navigational/Planets/Akuria\|Akuria]]. A more deragatory nickname for their species is *Snow Demons*. They are tall, white-furred sapients similar in height and build to Wookiees, with crests of hair running along their scalps from nose to nape of neck. They are an intelligent species, but lack a common language and do not appear to communicate with outsiders at all.
