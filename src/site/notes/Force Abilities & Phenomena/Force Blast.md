# Force Blast
Force Blast is a Force power used by darksiders and modeled on [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Sith magic\|Sith magic]]. Practitioners project concentrated blasts of pure dark side energy at objects or opponents, usually with devastating effects. Such blasts can obliterate objects and destroy living creatures. In its heightened form, called *Sickening Blast*, it can complete dissolve an opponent's physical body. 

This power is one that requires significant training to perfect; virtually no practitioners demonstrate any "natural" talent with the ability. This may be due to its roots in [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Sith magic\|Sith magic]]. Sometimes users suffer burns on their flesh, especially on their "casting" hand, but feel no pain. 

A universal version of this ability merely compresses the air to blast at enemies, as opposed to dark side energy, but this version is essentially identical to the [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Telekinesis#Force Push (Force Shove)\|Force Push]].
