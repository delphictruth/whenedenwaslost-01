# Force empathy
Force empathy is a form of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force sense\|Force sense]] and allows the user to sense an individual's feelings and general emotional state. [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-sensitives]] tend to develop low-grade Force empathy naturally, but trained practitioners can also sense motivations, hidden feelings, and deeply guarded secrets through an individual's emotional state. 

A heightened form of Force empathy is known as Receptive Telepathy. Force-users with Receptive Telepathy are able to sense the emotional states of those around them at all times, without having to exert effort to access low-level empathy, and typically can get a deeper read on an individual's emotions before having to invade their mind.

## Receptive Telepathy
Receptive telepathy is a [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force sense\|Sense]]-based Force power which allows [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force-sensitive\|Force-users]] to actively read a person's thoughts and feel their emotions; it is considered the more active and constant form of [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Force empathy\|Force empathy]]. In some cases, the Force-user can search a target's memories for specific information. It is easier to use on individuals who are close to the Force-user emotionally, and some individuals, such as other Force-users, can actively resist the technique. 

It is not necessarily the same as the Dark-side technique [[Force Abilities & Phenomena/Mind Probe\|Mind Probe]], but is it very similar. The distinction is that receptive telepathy is considered a more universal power, less invasive, and can be utilized without actually entering into the target's thoughts. Users are sometimes called *empaths*.
